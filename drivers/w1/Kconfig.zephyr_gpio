	  This option enables the w1 zephyr serial driver.

	  The bus reset, and bit read and write operations are executed
	  via bytes read and write operations on top of the zephyr
	  serial driver interface.

	help
	  The bit read timeout specifies how long the driver tries to read the
	  uart byte (1-wire bit data bit).
	  For serial drivers where poll_out does not block until the transfer is
	  complete, it must at least be greater than 87us (10bits / 115200baud).
